Firstly, I was intrigued. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is\nit? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why Boys\n+ Girls? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\nshould I talk about? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly and most importantly \u2013 hat or no hat?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What it was \u2013 an absolutely top class international event bringing together a really brilliant range of speakers including the global head of innovation at Zenith, Head of Design at Droga 5, CEO of the brilliant Lola, part of Mullen Lowe in Madrid, Head of Esports Sponsorships with Riot Games etc. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uniquely in my experience, the speakers managed to cover a range of complementary topics without ever repeating each other \u2013 and there wasn\u2019t one dud presentation all day.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless I was the dud and they were just being polite\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one theme that seemed to ring through all the talks was that creative work works best when it\u2019s charged with appealing to our less rational, human side \u2013 the right side of the brain. Remembering that emotionally-based, empathetic work based around clear strategy is the path to commercial success no matter what the market, that our work can have either a positive or negative effect on the world and that we should take all personal responsibility for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The venue was both brilliant and daunting; a 1,200-seater theatre replete with the biggest screen I had ever seen. Kudos to the small but brilliantly professional team who put the whole thing together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that\u2019s what it was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why Boys\n+ Girls? Turns out we created a couple of fans at our talk with Three + YouTube\nat Cannes Lions in June. They liked our collaborative, honest and open approach\nto creativity and the work and results that it produced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What should I talk about? I decided early that I wanted to continue the onwards march of Megacrab. I hoped that Megacrab\u2019s message of Branded Entertainment as the best vehicle for commercial success for ambitious brands\u2014albeit with an entirely new presentation deck and examples\u2014would land with the audience. And I\u2019m delighted and relieved to say it did, with Three\u2019s work with Arranmore as the real hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/megacrab-1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1544\" srcset=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/megacrab-1.gif 480w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/megacrab-1-300x169.gif 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And the\nhat? I had every intention of wearing the hat\u2026.but I must confess when I saw\nthe size of the theatre I wimped out. Looking at the pictures of the venue you\ncan decide if that was a good idea or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I\u2019d like to thank Kornelia and all the Imagination Day team over in Poland for their gracious hosting and for running such a professionally excellent and interesting event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\nDzi\u0119kuj\u0119\nCi<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What I Warsaw indeed.
