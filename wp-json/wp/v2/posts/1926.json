Putting in place behaviours that make them feel more in control, from stockpiling toilet paper and frozen goods at the start of the pandemic, to the early Christmas shopping and precautionary savings that are more prevalent 7 months in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As brands and communicators, how can we help consumers feel more in control, safer and more hopeful and confident about the future?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Preparation &amp; Planning will be valued, what expertise or guidance can our brands impart?&nbsp; From home renovation to healthier eating.<\/li><li>Can we help people stay on track?&nbsp; From saving goals, to fitness, to new hobbies?<\/li><li>How do we help them stay strong?&nbsp; E.g. connected to services, friends\/family etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>TREND 2: LIGHT RELIEF<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers are feeling the pressure of being cooped up at home, too many hours on Zoom calls, lack of the relief valve of getting out and socialising, worried about the future, all of which make them look for leisure activities that are not especially taxing. &nbsp; This creates a rising need for light-hearted content and escapism as a counter to the increasing intensity of their everyday lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands should be thinking about (where appropriate)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Being sources of distraction and positivity.<\/li><li>Creating virus free zones.&nbsp; Many influences are already making this promise to their followers.<\/li><li>How they can soothe rather than inform.<\/li><li>How they can bring fun, hope and joy into the lives of their consumers through comms?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now more than ever, we need to tap into our own resilience and find ways to turn this pandemic to our advantage by making sure that we are informed with the right information, interpreted correctly to take on 2021 and win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want further information, please contact any of your team in Boys+Girls or contact me at <a href=\"&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x6d;&#97;&#x72;&#103;&#x61;&#114;&#x65;&#116;&#x2e;&#103;&#x69;&#108;&#x73;&#101;&#x6e;&#97;&#x6e;&#64;&#x62;&#111;&#x79;&#115;&#x61;&#110;&#x64;&#103;&#x69;&#114;&#x6c;&#115;&#x2e;&#105;&#x65;\">&#x6d;&#x61;&#x72;&#x67;&#x61;&#x72;&#x65;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x69;&#108;&#115;&#101;&#110;&#97;&#110;&#64;boysan&#x64;&#x67;&#x69;&#x72;&#x6c;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x69;&#x65;<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The following information is taken from learnings across WARC, Foresight Factory and McKinsey.
