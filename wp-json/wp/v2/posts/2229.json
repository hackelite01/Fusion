One, that as quoted from Meg Kinney, <em>\u201cEvery business problem is a human problem, and every data point represents some human behaviour at its core\u201d<\/em>; and two, to provide truly creative solutions to those problems, each of us will be better and more open to new thinking if we are compulsively curious.<\/p>\n<p>The book is divided into three sections, each peppered with examples and insights from Tett\u2019s own experiences, huge social issues and the corporate world.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Making the \u201cStrange\u201d Familiar<\/strong>. It challenges us to stop shying away from that which seems strange, but rather work with it.\u00a0 To recognise that your worldview is not everyone\u2019s. There is a nice example to do with in-car technology.\u00a0 Car drivers had been asked direct questions about technology which they claimed to be using.\u00a0 Engineers installed embedded voice command systems in cars to reduce distracted driving.\u00a0 They were starting with their own world view of it. But subsequently when observed, drivers were using the technology but not through the in-built in-car tech, they were actually using their personal handheld devices.\u00a0 So, the solution which we see in most cars nowadays is the ability to sync our own personal devices with our cars i.e. looking at the world through the user&#8217;s eyes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Making the \u2018Familiar\u201d Strange<\/strong>. As Anais Nin said <em>\u201cwhat we are familiar with, we fail to see\u201d<\/em>.\u00a0 With Tett\u2019s experience as The Financial Time\u2019s, Editor At Large \u2013 there are numerous examples from the financial world and how that familiarity or normalising of certain behaviours, acronyms etc within the financial \u2018tribe\u2019 played a significant role in the 2008 crash.\u00a0 She challenges us to think and study our own WEIRD world (Western, Educated, Individualistic, Rich and Democratic) to help understand (and stop missing) behaviours and triggers that shape our decisions, with examples including how after an anthropological study of food preparation, Campbell\u2019s Soup successfully moved their marketing emphasis from convenience (the reported benefit) to creativity (the observed benefit) of their brand in its users lives.<br \/><br \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Listen to Social Silence<\/strong> and see what is hidden in plain sight. To see beyond the words that are being spoken and create frames of analysis that help us make sense of all that is going on&#8230; examples here from Trump (and why his use of the word \u2018Bigly\u2019 should not have been dismissed) and Cambridge Analytica.<br \/><br \/><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It also helps us use Big Data more effectively, <em>\u201cWe have been forced to rethink some of the ways we use data, at the beginning there was a lot of excitement about Big Data and we still firmly believe that getting better statistics is very important and technology can do amazing things.\u00a0 But we cannot be na\u00efve \u2013 understanding the social context matters\u201d<\/em>, Melinda Gates.<\/p>\n<p>This book provokes each of us to ask the right questions.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h4>Who should read it<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is not a marketing book; it is for anyone who recognises the importance and value of being compulsively curious. Across all disciplines.<\/li>\n<li>Anyone who is working with Big Data as a deeper cultural understanding or open-mindedness will complement and give context to that Data making it more valuable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"block-editor-rich-text__editable block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected rich-text\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"group\" contenteditable=\"true\" aria-multiline=\"true\" aria-label=\"Block: Heading\" data-block=\"74e7105b-e033-458c-8a1d-58caaf4249ec\" data-type=\"core\/heading\" data-title=\"Heading\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Anthropology Can Explain Business &amp; Life.
