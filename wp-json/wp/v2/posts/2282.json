Setting your own goals, beating your own previously held records.<\/p>\n<p>Here are ten benefits (there are probably more) outlining the common themes across all my reading that healthy competition* brings with it\u2026 in life, in sport, in business.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It keeps us on our toes<\/strong>. Having a competitive nature prevents complacency.\u00a0 If you succeed, you are motivated to always improve.\u00a0 If you fail, you can use it to motivate yourself to keep going.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li><strong>It generates more clarity<\/strong>. You can\u2019t be competitive at something unless you know what you are aiming for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It inspires greater creativity<\/strong>. To do things better, you need to be a better problem solver and be more solution driven.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It causes you to do more self-reflection<\/strong>. To do better, you will need to know your strengths and weaknesses, and identify what you need to improve.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It compels us to give things a go<\/strong>. Because competitive people tend to see failure as part of the journey not the end of it. They are more comfortable failing, in the hope that next time will be better\/successful.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It is satisfying<\/strong>. When managed properly, and realistically, it brings the satisfaction of completing goals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It motivates us to strive to do better.<\/strong> <em>&#8220;Believing that your competition is stronger and better than you pushes you to better yourselves.&#8221;<\/em> Simon Sinek.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It makes us resilient.<\/strong> Competitive people don\u2019t always win, they have to have wider comfort zones.\u00a0 You learn to cope with failing, to dust yourself down, and get back on that horse.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It makes us makes us hopeful.<\/strong> You look to the competition, and ask if they can do it so can I?\u00a0 You focus on the good, and ignore the bad.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li><strong>It helps us to live fuller lives<\/strong>, because you live with the belief that anything is possible. Michael Jordan: <em>&#8220;You have competition every day because you set such high standards for yourself that you have to go out every day and live up to that.&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Off now to compete against myself,\u00a0 Je pars pour \u00e9tablir un nouveau record personnel en Duolingo.<\/p>\n<p><em>* Disclaimer: Love this picture of the Bonny Baby competition in Butlins but do not consider it \u2018Healthy Competition\u2019.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Margaret Gilsenan, Chief Strategy Officer For anyone who has entered industry awards, you will know they are hard work.\u00a0 The AIMs, D&amp;ADs, ICADs, Sharks, Effies, Cannes, all involve various levels of selecting work, poring over data, writing papers, creating case films.\u00a0 And when you have an entry date looming, you ask yourself the question\u2026 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2283,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"pgc_sgb_lightbox_settings":""},"categories":[3,4],"tags":[18],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.1.1 -
