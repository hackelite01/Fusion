And for an agency to make an impact on today\u2019s world for its clients, it\u2019s going to need some pretty sharp minds. But what sort of minds? The job of a creative in 2018 is overwhelming in its breadth. The days when combining an arresting image and a precise line of copy on a billboard summed the job up seem like ancient history. We live in world where creatives are grappling with the intricacies of the Blockchain and trying to apply their ideas to the dozens of digital mediums brands now exist in. They need to show the same kind of problem-solving talents as ever, but in a landscape that\u2019s never been so fragmented.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Rather than ask creative directors what they want from new talent, <a href=\"https:\/\/lbbonline.com\/\">LBB<\/a>\u2019s Alex Reeves asked six Irish creatives at the start of their careers for their perspectives on the sort of people agencies should be looking to build their futures with. Two of those were our very own Cian O&#8217;Connell and Georgia Murphy.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Cian O\u2019Connell &#8211; Junior Art Director<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-764 size-small-custom\" src=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/CianOC_04-300x452.jpg\" alt=\"Cian O'Connell - Art Director\" width=\"300\" height=\"452\" align=\"right\" srcset=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/CianOC_04-300x452.jpg 300w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/CianOC_04-768x1156.jpg 768w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/CianOC_04-1000x1505.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/CianOC_04-600x903.jpg 600w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/CianOC_04.jpg 1661w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>From your experience of entering the industry recently, what sort of person grows up wanting to become an advertising creative these days?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>COC&gt;<\/strong> When I was in school I was never really told about art college. The conversation always steered towards academia when it came to courses and colleges, I distinctly remember the day I heard about art college and I thought to myself, \u201cyep, that\u2019s for me\u201d. Then, when I got to NCAD my work was more design\/typography inclined so I managed to get into the visual communications course where the term advertising was almost scoffed at. &#8216;Art director&#8217; wasn\u2019t in my vocabulary and I didn\u2019t really know it existed, but there was something in the back of my mind telling me that graphic design wasn\u2019t the right way to go. I spent about eight months figuring out what work I liked doing and where my passions lay, this led me to art direction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>And how do you think aspiring creatives now differ from the aspiring creatives of the past?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>COC&gt;<\/strong> I feel like creatives of the past stayed in their lane a lot more. Copywriters were copywriters and art directors were art directors, the lines are a lot more blurred these days. Along with this, I think creatives are pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in terms of changing social, environmental and many other issues through advertising campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>What talents or traits do you think are commonly undervalued by agencies when recruiting new creatives?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>COC&gt;<\/strong> The hunger to work. I think a hunger and a passion to work can outweigh any other trait. If you have a combination of talent and hunger, it should be a no-brainer. I also think that the ability to learn quickly can often be undervalued. New creatives can be shielded from certain things, like presentations and pitches when essentially it\u2019s an enormous part of the job &#8211; even if you\u2019re not speaking you should be present to learn from the senior members in the agency. Luckily, I\u2019ve been included in presentations from early on so I\u2019ve been soaking up all of the word-wizardry I can.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>And is there anything that they overvalue?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>COC&gt;<\/strong> Maybe a portfolio. I\u2019m not sure a person\u2019s book is the be-all and end-all, I think a proper conversation can unearth a lot more about their style of thinking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>What did you find most challenging about trying to get into the industry?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>COC&gt;<\/strong> Getting my foot in the door (it was more of a drop kick). Dublin is small and saturated with tonnes of great creatives. Everyone knows everyone so, when there is a free space in an agency, friends or acquaintances will get the nod first to get their work in front of a creative director.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>How do you think agencies should make sure they&#8217;re recruiting from a broader pool of talent?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>COC&gt;<\/strong> The industry should be pushed towards providing properly paid internships. Without this, it\u2019s cutting off everyone who can\u2019t afford to intern for little or no pay which is a shame. If the talent pool in Ireland was to be represented as a pizza, the ad agencies are eating one slice and leaving the rest to go to waste. More talent means better work, so dig in CDs, bon app\u00e9tit!<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>Is the distinction between art and copy still relevant to young creatives? What value do you think there is in that distinction?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>COC&gt;<\/strong> Both art and copy are still relevant but I think there needs to be more of an awareness between what both do so that they can learn from each other. I think it\u2019s pretty important that I can also write copy and understand the tone needed for the project that I\u2019m working on. In turn, I think copywriters need to know their way around some of the Adobe suite so that they can visualise what is in their mind. In terms of the value of that distinction, I still think the combination of the two makes for a great spark in idea generation.<\/p>\n<h2>Georgia Murphy &#8211; Junior Copywriter<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-774 size-small-custom\" src=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GMurph_03-300x450.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia Murphy - Copywriter\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" align=\"right\" srcset=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GMurph_03-300x450.jpg 300w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GMurph_03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GMurph_03-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GMurph_03-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GMurph_03.jpg 1667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>From your experience of entering the industry recently, what sort of person grows up wanting to become an advertising creative these days?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>GM&gt;<\/strong> A person that doesn\u2019t want to grow up. I spent a lot of time in the world that was in my head as a kid and probably still do. I always knew what I wanted to be and would go off on tangents trying to explain it. Then somebody told me what a copywriter did.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>And how do you think aspiring creatives now differ from the aspiring creatives of the past?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>GM&gt;<\/strong> As the industry is more fragmented now the road to success isn\u2019t as clearly sign posted. Back in the day art and copy were much more segregated. Now there are a lot more mediums and you\u2019re expected to have a wider range of skills, it\u2019s a given that in addition to your normal job you have at least one hobby that you\u2019re turning into a fruitful side business. The best of this generation are all multihyphenates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>What talents or traits do you think are commonly undervalued by agencies when recruiting new creatives?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>GM&gt;<\/strong> Hard work. Talent can sit on the cool bean bag or swivel chair in your agency and tell you about great work, hard work will make it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>And is there anything that they overvalue?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>GM&gt;<\/strong> There\u2019s no magic formula to advertising, I\u2019ve searched. I think inexperience is sometimes forgotten about. Watching how senior creatives work, solving a problem or presenting work is invaluable. It\u2019s a fast-moving job where there isn\u2019t always time for teaching moments but if a little more time is taken to break it down at the start, the work can go ten times faster the next time. Give a man a fish he\u2019ll eat for a day, teach junior creatives how to work and hopefully they\u2019ll win you some awards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>What did you find most challenging about trying to get into the industry?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>GM&gt;<\/strong> Prying open that door. The industry in Ireland is quite small, everybody knows everyone working in it so if you don\u2019t have a reputation that precedes you or at least a distant cousin in the business you have to be a little bit more relentless (stage a sit-in and refuse to leave) starting out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>How do you think agencies should make sure they&#8217;re recruiting from a broader pool of talent?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>GM&gt;<\/strong> There are certain briefs that are put out to art colleges; I think they should be put out to all colleges. Industry bodies, and agencies themselves, should cast a broader net to attract more diverse talent. An idea can come from anywhere and so can fresh new creatives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LBB&gt;<\/strong> <em>Is the distinction between art and copy still relevant to young creatives? What value do you think there is in that distinction?<\/em><br \/>\n <strong>GM&gt;<\/strong> Yes and no. It is still relevant when people have a passion for the side they\u2019ve chosen. I must admit I\u2019ve probably given my partner an extra wrinkle or two with my current technological abilities and figuring out which words work best beside each other brings me an alarming amount of joy. I think for the exciting part (coming up with ideas) there\u2019s no distinction. You both see an idea from a different perspective which only serves to make your work better.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https:\/\/lbbonline.com\/news\/taking-a-sample-of-dublins-new-creative-blood\/\">Little Black Book<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Little Black Book profiled two of our young creatives, Cian O&#8217;Connell and Georgia Murphy, for their take on the future of advertising in Ireland.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1012,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"pgc_sgb_lightbox_settings":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.1.1 -
