And other Kinsale Shark tales."},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Wow, that was intense.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The rebooted Kinsale Sharks 2018 was as raucous and inspirational as ever.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Gone was the infamous sit down Gala Awards Ceremony (Bloody right that\u2019s Trevor Beattie at the next table), and instead the festival organisers served up a cracking lineup of speakers, including the legendary Mark Denton and Nils Leonard &#8211; to name just two.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It wasn\u2019t Mark Denton\u2019s iconic outdoor work for Nike and Wrangler that stuck in the mind (that was already firmly fixed \u2013 Michael Jordan versus Isaac Newton anyone?), it was that when a great idea takes shape in his<br \/>\n imagination he doesn\u2019t rest until it finds form in the world. Here\u2019s a man who believes that a great idea shouldn\u2019t die before it\u2019s had the chance to live. To hell with the whim of a client lacking faith in a thought, Mark Denton makes up for it in abundance. And when his belief in an idea\u2019s potential is harnessed with unwavering self-belief he creates work that transcends its initial iteration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That same creative drive, one that\u2019s reluctant to bend to a higher authority other than the work itself, was also a theme of Nils Leonard\u2019s talk. Uncommon is founded on the principal of only working with brands that share a common belief to \u2018make a difference\u2019 in the world, and if those brands are in short supply then the team at Uncommon will create them, such as Halo, the world\u2019s first compostable coffee capsule.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He passionately expressed the need for agencies to be stronger about backing their own ideas instead of waiting for approval. It reminded me of a Seth Godin quote that what makes someone a professional is that they can<br \/>\n be unsupervised, but instead we are all too guilty of waiting for approval before acting on our better instincts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And when you follow your better instincts you will uncover great work. What are the things that stir you? What makes you angry? What do you care about more than anything else. What pisses you off? These are the questions Nils Leonard asks of himself and it\u2019s reflected in his work. Like Mark Denton, it demonstrates a level of personal investment in the work that elevates it beyond the ordinary.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Like any creative work, its merits, or lack of, can be debated a million different ways from an infinite number of perspectives, but one thing that is irrefutable is an aura of passion radiating from work that\u2019s born of a deep personal investment. That care does shine through.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It also shone through in terms of the work that was recognised by the judges this year. Of course, like at any advertising awards show, that recognition was as predictable as it was unpredictable, with Golds for already iconic work including Wieden+Kennedy\u2019s Nike Nothing beats a Londoner film, Energy BBDO\u2019s Prescribed to Death campaign, as well as the beautifully crafted film work by Nexus for Wimbledon and the Winter Olympics.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Irish advertising more than held its own on the International stage, and at Boys + Girls we were delighted to take home 7 Sharks for a myriad of different clients, including Energia, Irish Heart Foundation, \u0160KODA and Three.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But as I absorbed all the wonderful work I was reminded of the fact that while the briefs come and go, as we move quickly from one campaign to the next, and while this months work is on air and we\u2019re already thinking about next year, there\u2019s one constant \u2013 you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As the great copywriter, Paul Fishlock, once said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t enjoy writing it, you can sure as fuck bet nobody will enjoy reading it.\u201d So don\u2019t just do your job, throw yourself into it. Invest every ounce of your being, and leave nothing behind knowing you will resurface in the work, and find new form in unexpected and brilliant ways.<\/p>\n<p>This article first appeared in Little Black Book https:\/\/lbbonline.com\/<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wow, that was intense.
