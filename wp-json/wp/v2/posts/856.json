The category awards work that set out to positively impact ingrained gender inequality, imbalance or injustice.<\/p>\n<p>The Jury President this year was very fitting \u2014 the inimitable Madonna Badger, Founder &amp; CCO of Badger &amp; Winters, a purpose-driven U.S. agency that are on a mission to rewrite how women are portrayed in advertising.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Madonna and her jury awarded 11 Glass Lions, from a shortlist of 27. Here are the key sub-themes that featured within the work, along with examples that endeavoured for change in this space.<\/p>\n<h2>Gender inequality in sports<span style=\"color: #f03694;\">+<\/span>gaming<\/h2>\n<p>Nike\u2019s <strong>\u2018The Lioness Crest\u2019<\/strong> celebrated Dutch women\u2019s unique attitude to and identity within sport, designing the Dutch women\u2019s football team their own unique lioness crest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#MyGameMyName<\/strong>, Telefonica\/Vivo Brazil\u2019s online gaming initiative addressed online sexual harassment in the gaming world by highlighting the issue amongst the wider gaming community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2018Sisters in Sweat\u2019<\/strong> by Gatorade featured a powerful message from tennis legend Serena Williams to her daughter and all schoolgirls about the wonders of team sports.<\/p>\n<h2>Motherhood<span style=\"color: #f03694;\">+<\/span>injustice<\/h2>\n<p><strong>The Pregnancy Pause<\/strong>\u2019s LinkedIn initiative helped mothers avoid CV gaps which have a negative impact on their employment prospects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#StandByToughMoms,<\/strong> All Out\u2019s endeavour to bring the hidden stresses of tough Indian moms into the open and ignite a national conversation around the subject.<\/p>\n<p>Baby Dove\u2019s <strong>\u2018Beautifully Real Moms\u2019<\/strong> shouted loud that being a real mom is so much more beautiful than being perfect.<\/p>\n<h2>Violence against women<\/h2>\n<p>A really active territory this year with a plethora of entries seeking to tackle this issue. Highlights included UNICEF\u2019s <strong>\u2018The Worst Soap Opera\u2019<\/strong> which won Gold and highlighted the Dominican Republic\u2019s child marriage epidemic through the medium of the nationally popular TV soap opera.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2018The Dress for Respect\u2019<\/strong> from Schweppes Brazil, an initiative to encourage open and public conversation about sexual harassment.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>\u2018Rape Tax\u2019<\/strong> by the National Organization for Victim Assistance which brought to life the reality of rape victims in the U.S. getting hit with medical bills following their attacks.<\/p>\n<h2>Female opportunity<span style=\"color: #f03694;\">+<\/span>development<\/h2>\n<p>Samsung\u2019s Technical School brought a shift to the mentality of Indian society towards the girl child and the patriarchal practice of calling daughters \u2018<strong>beta\u2019<\/strong>, an Indian word for son.<\/p>\n<p>Also out of India, the Times of India\u2019s <strong>\u2018No Conditions Apply\u2019<\/strong>, which also won Gold, is a platform which works towards better representation of women in India and sees the newspaper identify opportunities for intervention in Bengali culture where they can be a true catalyst of positive and progressive change in the U.S. <br \/>\n as part of GE\u2019s Balance.<\/p>\n<p>The Equation initiative, which aims to hire, promote and retain more women in science and technology, created <strong>\u2018Unseen Stars\u2019<\/strong>, an activation that featured live projection mapping in Grand Central Station depicting 12 pioneering female scientists.<\/p>\n<h2>Menstrual stigma<\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u2018Blood Normal\u2019<\/strong> by Essity challenged the stigma and taboo that surrounds periods by showing them as a normal part of life. Shockingly they are the first menstrual product brand to show period blood that looks like actual blood (not bright blue, not clinical-looking).<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>\u2018Tampon Tax Off\u2019<\/strong> from Tesco, saw the brand removing the tax on sanitary wear to positively impact millions of women across the U.K. because they don\u2019t believe women should be taxed for being women.<\/p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, Stayfree\u2019s <strong>\u2018Project Free Period\u2019<\/strong> identified an opportunity to use periods to normalise the lives of Indian commercial sex trade workers by providing them with skills that could generate future sustainable incomes.<\/p>\n<h2>The Grand Prix winner?<\/h2>\n<p>Blood Normal from Essity. The campaign had a PR reach of <br \/>\n over 4.5 billion, a 72% positive reaction to the work, and the brand\u2019s share of social voice rose from 37% to 90%. Influencers and collaborators got on board and spread the blood normal message and by gaining traction in news and culture, the campaign found its way onto the television stations they were originally banned from. A worthy winner.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing this brave work at Cannes, work that was gallant enough to use what we do on a daily basis to tackle societal issues, was a great reminder of the power and potential of our industry \u2014 a reminder that these awards are not about back-patting, but actual transformative change <br \/>\n on a global scale.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Read the next article:<\/h4>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/news\/keeping-it-real\/\">Keeping it real<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>by Derek Doyle, Head of Production<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Or see <a href=\"\/news\/category\/cannes2018\/\">all our articles from Cannes Lions 2018<\/a><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Glass Lions, or The Lions for Change, celebrate ideas intended to change the world.
