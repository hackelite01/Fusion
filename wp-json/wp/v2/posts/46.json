A small word to takeaway from a 4 day festival but it\u2019s one I want tattoo on my arm.<\/p>\n<p>To remind me every day the type of work I want to aspire to do. Break the rules, challenge the norms and stop putting logos down the bottom right of ads. To me it\u2019s what the ad industry in Dublin is missing.<\/p>\n<p>Bravery was the main theme of talks at Kinsale. Bravery from Creative directors, Clients and CEO\u2019s. Here\u2019s a quick question. Have you done anything brave in work in the last 6 months? Try and answer that 100% honestly. Robert Senior one of the founding members of Fallon who brought us ads like Cadbury\u2019s Gorilla and Sony balls posed the question \u201cIf it goes wrong what\u2019s at stake? Your job, your reputation the account? It\u2019s only brave if there is a risk it won\u2019t work, won\u2019t sell or see light of day. But what\u2019s the other option? The road to blandness, mediocrity? Surely that isn\u2019t an option.<\/p>\n<p>Guillaume Rebbot from BETC in Paris spoke about a chain of bravery. When we go to make work everybody has to be on board with the same goal. Every partner or person we work with needs to know at the start of a job that the aim to is to push the idea to the max. That means work will take longer. There will probably be more arguments. More changes. More crafting. But it also means work will be better.<\/p>\n<p>We can be Brave in lots of different ways. Hiring people who have little experience but want a shot in our industry. How about we find someone who never had the opportunity to go to college? What if different experiences in life would lead to a richer tapestry of work. Let\u2019s cast people who break the stereotypical norms of advertising in Ireland. And I\u2019m talking about real people ads, I\u2019m talking about finding the unexpected, forgotten or ignored.<\/p>\n<p>We can also be brave in how we challenge the advertising clich\u00e9s of our industry. What if we ban emails after 6? Literally ban them. Tell all our clients after 6 is down time. You\u2019ll find us in the forty foot, at a play or bringing our dog for a walk while grabbing an ice cream at Teddy\u2019s. What if we gave a random 2 days off to everybody to go out and bring something new back to the agency that they learned in that time? Timesheet code 102112112 under generally inexpensive way to get fresh ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Finally as an industry let\u2019s try to find one brave thing to do every week. Brave doesn\u2019t have to be big. It can be challenging the conventional ideas on the table at a meeting. It can be saying no to a client request. \u00a0It can be small like David but knock down the things that can get in our way to becoming a better, braver industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Creative Director Laurence O\u2019Byrne shares his thoughts on judging at the Kinsale Sharks and the overarching theme of Bravery Brave.
