The BBC broadcaster, writer and host of the Soundtracking podcast remembers how this all changed soon after she started there. \u201cSuddenly they started showing reality shows and the music video died.\u201d As we chat in a shady spot on the last day of Cannes Lions, she recalls classics of the genre, running through Hype Williams\u2019 videography and reminiscing about the impact a simple film like the Arctic Monkeys\u2019 first video by Edith\u2019s friend Huse Monfaradi can have on culture. \u201cIt was a throwback to The Old Grey Whistle Test, which was so simple but so effective!\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edith\u2019s passion for the medium of music video has led her to get involved with Three\u2019s \u2018Made by Music\u2019 campaign, which has been championing promos for over a year now. She was in Cannes to chair a panel about the campaign\u2019s first year and earlier this week she jetted over to Ireland to launch the newest video in the campaign at the Dublin venue Opium.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rory Hamilton\u2019s appreciation for music video culture was key to his involvement in the project too. As chief creative officer at the agency Boys + Girls, he was instrumental in the collaboration between Three Ireland, YouTube and a series of musical artists that would become the stars of the campaign. He argues that music videos are important to culture again, that a good one can make a track. Look at Childish Gambino\u2019s This is America. Rory says it\u2019s \u201cone of the best pieces of film I saw all year\u201d.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re such a shared cultural experience,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the office, the first thing that happened [when that video emerged] was everybody gathered around someone\u2019s computer to all watch this, now.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campaign started with Three\u2019s brand purpose: a \u201cbetter connected life\u201d. Trying to reach young audiences, the agency and client soon came to the realisation that if they could celebrate the connections that are made by music, they\u2019d be in a strong place.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rory admits that at first the agency wrote the big brand ad they\u2019d usually go for. But quickly they realised it wouldn\u2019t engage with the young audience Three wanted to reach. Three had to prove its role in music, not just tell young people that they cared.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually they landed on the idea of creating music culture, not just piggybacking on it,&nbsp; making three music videos with Three\u2019s brand purpose baked into them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They went to record labels, music video directors and collaborated with YouTube to select three artists to showcase. They landed on Saint Sister, Kormac and Jafaris &#8211; three very different performers. Elaine Carey, chief commercial officer and chief marketing officer at Three Ireland, explains their decision: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to alienate a segment. So we had to get three different varieties of music. [At that age] you\u2019re very distinct with what you want your sound to be. And you don\u2019t tend to deviate from what we saw from the insights and the research. You want the music you like. We were very conscious not to pick one genre.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Directing a series of music videos was out of Boys + Girls\u2019 comfort zone in a sense. The filmmaking process with music video directors is different. Edith highlights this as one of the reasons she loves the medium. \u201cA director\u2019s got his vision from the audio. I like when they\u2019re given that opportunity to just run with it. The band or the artist don\u2019t have that much influence. They\u2019re not in it, particularly. It fits so perfectly because it\u2019s another person\u2019s interpretation of that creative.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rory explains that the agency team had to be way more hands off than they were used to. \u201cWe found it\u2019s a much more collaborative process with the director, rather than me writing a script and telling them what happens in it. We said they were getting free reign as long as they answered this brief. The client didn\u2019t attend the shoot. We weren\u2019t over their shoulder the whole time, the way you would be in an ad. Everybody benefited from it and it meant that they could apply their creativity, adding to it rather than having that restraint.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working collaboratively with YouTube, the largest music platform in the world, meant Boys + Girls could draw on a lot of data for insights to inform how the videos took shape. In the panel in the Cannes Palais, YouTube\u2019s head of Ireland Elaine Doyle revealed that brave framing and close-ups work well on the platform, for example. The process of making and launching one video, drawing insights and then moving on to make the next one was key here. In the panel session Rory noted that YouTube\u2019s date proved that quite an esoteric shot of an owl in one of the videos was key to that video\u2019s performance. Once viewers saw that shot, they were significantly more likely to continue watching, Elaine said. \u201cWe learned from the data and were understanding as we filmed what was working for the next one and the next one,\u201d adds Elaine from Three.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they were happy to put owls in the videos, but never lay the Three brand on too thick. \u201cAll of us agreed at the very start that we would be genuine in the way that we approached it,\u201d says Rory. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to try and put a handset in everybody\u2019s hand. We\u2019d go to the spirit of it.\u201d The only branding was at the end of each of the videos, where the logo and campaign line was delivered.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something that impressed Edith about the campaign: \u201cThe way that it wasn\u2019t compromising the artists\u2019 integrity in any way, shape or form. It was about the talent and the creative drive of the artists and the directors of the videos to really push those artists. I thought that was really unheard of.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results of the first three videos were potent. To illustrate this, fewer Irish people skipped the Made By Music videos than a Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z campaign that was running at one point during the campaign.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVery quickly we knew that we were going to continue it,\u201d says Elaine at Three. \u201cWe saw the results. We had to do it for more than a 12-month period.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further evidence for the Made by Music campaign\u2019s authenticity is that the three artists they had selected became a supergroup in their own right, collaborating with each other organically to make a track together. \u201cThey would not have got together themselves naturally, I think,\u201d says Elaine Carey. \u201cThey were quite different.\u201d And that track &#8211; Causing Trouble &#8211; became the fourth video in the series, naturally.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From YouTube\u2019s perspective, Elaine from Three thought this fitted nicely with the way the data shows things are changing in youth culture in favour of more eclectic tastes. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an emerging trend &#8211; less siloed lanes of music. It\u2019s like what we were saying about the promotion of the campaign. If the content is really good\u2026 In this case the music was really good. So if someone saw Jafaris and loved the vibe, they would then also give the second one a chance and so on. We do see that. And not just in Ireland. There\u2019s a lot of diversification.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the success of this in mind, collaboration became the focus of the second year of the campaign, which kicked off at the end of June with a new track made by three artists coming together &#8211; Follow The Sound came from the process of Three throwing David Kitt, Fehdah and Kean Kavanagh in a studio. \u201cFrom diverse musical backgrounds they\u2019ve created a really arresting track,\u201d says Rory.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edith is excited about a corporate brand like Three playing a role in supporting music culture, not just capitalising on it: \u201cIt was about the music and the artists. And about Three being a brand that wanted to be associated with that, encouraging and helping that. It\u2019s hard for artists, especially at that level, for their heads to pop over the precipice. There\u2019s so much around, so anything that can give them a platform to showcase them is a great thing.\u201d<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article first appeared on Little Black Book on July 8th 2019\u00a0By Alex Reeves, Europe Editor, Little Black Book When Edith Bowman started her broadcasting career at MTV, music video was a core part of culture. \u201cIt was all about music videos,\u201d she says.
