Dubai is a city that has been created from the desert which is pretty mind blowing when you see the scale of it up close. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in Dubai for the\nfirst time, to judge Film Craft at the Dubai Lynx awards. This was one of those\nsituations in life when literally, you are totally going solo. On your todd; no\nwingman. It had the potential to just be an ordinary judging experience; the\nusual dark jury room for 3 days to objectively look at the work coming out of\nthe MENA region. However, it turns out when you fly people in from all around\nthe world who are passionate about film craft a funny thing can happen; you can\nbecome a mini family for a few days. I would call our particular family a little\ncrazy and a real melting pot of personalities, but that was the key as to why\nit worked. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our jury had a very outspoken\nDutch judge who was a super duelling partner for a strong minded Canadian judge.\nMix that in with a funny and charming Italian and Iranian and top that off with\na Spanish gent who we nick named Super Mario, a New Yorker and the Irishman who\nis writing this article and not to forget our Jury President from Australia and\nthings can get interesting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the great judging\nexperience, in the evenings we experienced some incredible Middle Eastern\nhospitality. Our whole jury got invited to the local judge\u2019s family home. We\nwere greeted at the door by the whole family and a Lebanese feast emerged. We\nate a myriad of traditional Lebanese dishes from Lebanese fattoush salad to tabbouleh.\nThis was the Middle Eastern collective warmth that I had heard about, the\nexchanging of stories around a table in a beautiful family garden in a Dubai.\nIt was a million miles away from the dreaded scenario of pizza in your hotel\nroom after a long day in the jury room. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following day\u2019s judging led to no punches being pulled. Arguments were had. Laughs were let out. There was a kind of energy and debate every good jury room needs. There is a lot of tablet scoring for the first day where the jury is putting together its shortlist from which all this work is taken, into the second day where work is decided upon. As it\u2019s a relatively young advertising industry, awards in the MENA region are super important to creatives and agencies, with awards having a significant effect on the <g class=\"gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"11\" data-gr-id=\"11\">winners<\/g> businesses. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We watched nearly 200 pieces of work in the Film Craft category. Several themes emerged including many films which tackled the newly founded freedom for women in Saudi who are now legally allowed drive. There was a <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">campaign&nbsp; of<\/g> powerful films for Du Telco by Leo Burnett Dubai called Fire &amp; Crash which addressed how people need to stop posting unethical footage on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.34% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/328193306?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a piece that\npromoted a child safety app for viewing YouTube called Tuby which tackled the\ndangers of children getting caught up in viral challenges such as Blue Whale\nand Momo. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.34% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/328196482?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a mix\nof comedic work for an Elite Wafer, a confectionary brand and some nice\ncopywriting about the benefits of a Shattaf which is a type of hygiene\napparatus found in many bathrooms in Dubai. One really helpful resource at the\nfestival, is our jury was given a Cultural Expert in each jury room to make\nsure we had someone to ask about any nuances which might have an effect on the\nway we judged some of the work. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.34% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/328198002?title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p>The overall learning\nfor me from judging was that no matter where you are in the world, the best work\nalways stands out. It has a certain quality where the total is greater than the\nsum of the parts. Every little detail counts whether it\u2019s in sound,\ncinematography, casting or script. Along with a director\u2019s vison this makes the\nwork stand out and compete on a global stage. Dubai Lynx has the ambition for\nthis. Dubai has a relatively new advertising industry and huge ambition to\ncompete. And if the opportunity comes your way to judge at these awards I\u2019d say\ngrab the experience with both hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laurence O\u2019Byrne, <br>Creative Director <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last Sunday I jumped on a plane from Dublin to Dubai at 11am in the morning and arrived to a neon-lit Dubai at 3am.
