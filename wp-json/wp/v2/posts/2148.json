It features a young child crying out to their father &#8211; \u201cDaddy! Daddy! Look at me!\u201d The simple phrase is repeated over and over with the message at the end warning parents to never look away while their child is in the water. It\u2019s a hugely important message delivered in a powerful and impactful way. In fact, it will be running again this year as it was so successful last year and the reaction to our ad was overwhelming.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Yellow Pencil was awarded in the Writing for Advertising category in Radio &amp; Audio and the Graphite Pencil was awarded for Commercials Over 30 Seconds in Radio &amp; Audio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Swim Ireland &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Hey Daddy!
