It\u2019ll be there somewhere down near the bottom of the page, it may even have slipped onto page 2 (there should never be a page 2!). Read down past the Target Audience, past the Insight and the Proposition. Hit the Timings and you\u2019ve gone too far. There!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In it you\u2019ll find the form that the response to the\nbrief should take \u2013 it might be a campaign for social, it might suggest some TV\nor outdoor, or typically a radio ad that\u2019s already been booked at a length that\ncan\u2019t possibly fit the required Terms &amp; Conditions. Deliverables is a box\nthat appears on every brief, but it\u2019s a box which should be challenged, if not\ncompletely ignored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with Deliverables is that you can never\nknow the form that any campaign will take until you know what the idea is. And\nyou can\u2019t know that until after you\u2019ve been briefed. Sure, you can steer your\nthinking in a direction, nobody is suggesting that creative exploration should\ntake the form of an Ayahuasca fuelled vision-quest. Not yet anyway. But the\ntruth remains that the best work always comes when you approach a problem\nwithout the answer already in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More and more we are seeing campaigns that push the\nboundaries of what we call advertising. Campaigns that can\u2019t be contained in\nany pre-prescribed box, ones that don\u2019t look like ads at all. Big brands are\nmoving further and further outside of their comfort zones to produce\nground-breaking work to get noticed. In some ways this is a reaction to\nconsumer behaviour. By the time we have all installed ad blockers to avoid the\nplague or programmatic detritus creepily following us around the internet waiting\nfor a moment of weakness (jeez, get off the fence!), then brands have to take a\ndifferent approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have moved budgets into product development,\nchanging their marketing model from brand promises to brand proof. Nike are an\nexample of a brand who use innovation alongside advertising to keep themselves\nrelevant. By building an LED running track in Manilla back in 2017 they\ninspired runners around the world in spite of the fact that most would never\nset foot on their creation. Last year Nike converted an abandoned Church in\nChicago into a youth sports complex, winning fans around the world with a local\ninitiative and winning a Cannes Lions Grand Prix at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other brands have moved into Entertainment. Last\nyear Skittles, when faced with a brief for a Superbowl ad, produced a Broadway\nmusical starring Michael C. Hall (Dexter, to save you Googling). By producing a\ncampaign that was nothing like the Deliverables asked on the brief,&nbsp;\nSkittles wound up producing the most-talked-about Super Bowl ad of the year,\nand winning every major advertising award along the way. This wasn\u2019t a TV ad\ndressed up as a musical, it was the real thing. People went to a theatre and\npaid good money to go and see a musical about their brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in some ways Skittles and Nike aren\u2019t fair\nexamples, as brands they continually break the traditional rules of marketing\nand pushing boundaries is part of their DNA. Nike inspires an army of fans in a\nway that few other brands can dream of and Skittles have become famous for producing\nsweet little moments of madness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what about brands working in more conservative\nsegments? Well, last year Johnson and Johnson stepped away from the usual to\nproduce an incredibly moving documentary called 5B heroing the Nurses and\nDoctors on the front line of the Aids Epidemic in the early 1980\u2019s. They told\nan important story that spoke to their brand values, turning the notion of paid\nmedia on its head. Their brand wound up appearing in film festivals and\nadvertising awards around the world, something their advertising could never\ndo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are finally seeing this kind of work reach\nour shores. When I first heard about the House of Peroni opening in Dublin, any\ninitial disappointment that it wasn\u2019t actually a house made of beer (false\nadvertising!) quickly faded when I saw what an amazing job it did of\ncommunicating a simple brand idea. It\u2019s a stylish pop-up bar that provides an\nincredible brand experience for consumers, allowing people a chance to spend a\nfew hours with the brand. Yes, it\u2019s a single venue and one that\u2019s only open for\na short period to attendance is limited, but the halo effect that it creates\nfor the brand lives on much much longer. It generates huge word of mouth,\ncapturing influencers -though unfortunately releasing them a few hours later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that covers the \u201ctalk about other brands or\nthis\u2019ll look like an ad for your agency\u201d bit then with Boys + Girls, Three\nMobile have been venturing further from marketing\u2019s beaten track than ever\nbefore. In the past 18 months Three have gone from producing ads that talk\nabout their music sponsorship to actually getting involved in making music.\nLast year\u2019s Made By Music campaign saw them produce music videos for up and\ncoming artists that went on to break YouTube world records. This year Three\nhave gone further to produce collaborative music tracks, using music to connect\nthe brand to a valuable audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking a step away from brand promises and\nmoving into brand demonstration Three have managed to produce more interesting\nand more effective work. In order to demonstrate their brand purpose of a\n\u201cBetter Connected Life\u201d, we have been working with Three to turn Arranmore, an\nisland off the coast of Donegal into the \u201cMost Connected Island in the World\u201d. The\ncampaign is working with islanders to use connectivity to improve issues like\nhealthcare and environmental conservation while helping local industries like\nfishing and tourism to survive and thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is an argument against advertising. Great\nwork will always find a way of finding and connecting with its audience, but it\ndoes show that the best brands are going further out of their comfort zones to\nfind new audiences. Like all the examples listed, it\u2019s a campaign that goes\nbeyond traditional deliverables to make a real difference. But then creating\nreal change is probably something that should appear in the Deliverables box on\nevery brief.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Rory Hamilton, Executive Creative Director + Partner, Boys + Girls.
