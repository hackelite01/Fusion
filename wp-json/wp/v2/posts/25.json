He is also the creator of an animated series that you might possibly just spot on Netflix next year.<\/p>\n<p>But more on that later.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what O\u2019Byrne had to say about his career lessons from the fast lane of advertising, and how to get it so right that it will send echoes through the industry (and a few awards your way).<\/p>\n<h2>A mixed background<\/h2>\n<p>My background is pretty mixed \u2013 I studied computer animation in Ballyfermot College of Further Education and then in my\u00a0last year in art college, I got a scholarship to study psychology for four years. Then I worked with kids with autism for a few years, did a masters in advertising in IADT and then worked in most of the agencies.<\/p>\n<p>I think in advertising when it comes to people\u2019s backgrounds, it\u2019s a case of the more mixed the better \u2013 there\u2019s no direct line to come into it. Having a mixed background really helps you. I really like each person to take their own individual approach to things.<\/p>\n<h2>Passion projects<\/h2>\n<p>At interview stage, I always make sure that you\u2019re doing stuff that isn\u2019t just advertising. I\u2019ll look for their portfolio but what I\u2019m really interested in is what people do in their spare time that they are not being paid to do.<\/p>\n<p>I have an animation series called LSD that I\u2019ve been working on for the last five years, which will be released March. I\u2019ve\u00a0worked with guys in Dublin and London on it, and I am pitching it to the likes of Netflix and Amazon. It follows a group of dysfunctional heroes that are two inches tall \u2013 LSD stands for \u2018little suber dubs\u2019.<\/p>\n<h2>Knowing that creativity must have a function<\/h2>\n<p>We don\u2019t believe in creativity for creativity\u2019s sake \u2013 it must work on a practical level too. We worked with Amnesty International on a project called\u00a0White Christmas last year which was\u00a0rewarding but harrowing. By the time Christmas Day had come Aleppo had fallen and the city was destroyed. We had friends and family there telling us exactly what was happening which was really powerful in highlighting what was going on there.<\/p>\n<p>We also worked on an anti-bullying device with Dropbox called\u00a0BullyBug\u00a0with DCU\u2019s Professor Mona Moore who is one of the bullying experts in Europe. We\u2019re working with her to do a controlled study using the device. Dropbox had a hackathon and this came out of it so we wanted to take their project to the next level.<\/p>\n<h2>Not getting bogged down in e-mails<\/h2>\n<p>I usually kick off my day at 8am when I give myself 45 minutes to get rid of all my emails. It\u2019s the only time I believe in checking them so if you send me something at 10, 11 or 12 I\u2019m not going to read it. I have to spend my time working on ideas and helping my team.<\/p>\n<p>I have two kids and I\u2019ll spend time with them until they go to bed and then I\u2019ll spend an hour revising ideas after work. I find that the start and the end of the day is important to consolidate everything that happened throughout each day.<\/p>\n<h2>Not being afraid to use new technologies<\/h2>\n<p>The big change in the industry has been that there is now much more detail in images and video \u2013 images have gone from 10MB to 100MB images with 10mb to 100MB. Imagery is now much more advanced and there\u2019s much more post-production, more AR and VR and 360\u00ba camerawork.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m actually working on a 360 video for Barnardos that will be out in February\/March. With 360 video, you need to consider every angle of the room \u2013 you need to take into account everything behind the camera and clear the whole space. With it, viewers can go into any space so you need to guide people around your film in order to tell the story.<\/p>\n<h2>Looking internationally for inspiration<\/h2>\n<p>One brand that stood out in 2017 was the\u00a0Burger King Flame Grilled campaign\u00a0(seen in link). They had real pictures of a Burger King in Minnesota that went on fire which is a brave thing to do. Burger King is consistently challenging but with this they honed in on their unique selling point and knew how to get traction and get it trending.<\/p>\n<h2>Understanding the role of social media<\/h2>\n<p>Another thing that continues to be increasingly important in advertising is the role of social media. When you are creating a film for Facebook, it\u2019s completely different from how you make an ad.<\/p>\n<p>You need to know how to edit and display it in a way that grabs people \u2013 you\u2019ve got to put the hook up early, like in the first five or six seconds. In a lot of advertising, the kicker comes last so you need to approach it completely differently.<\/p>\n<h2>Trusting my team<\/h2>\n<p>Dealing with creative people who all have ideas is a very delicate process. When you\u2019re dealing with that it\u2019s always personal so you\u2019ve got to manage and nurture that so that they are able to fulfill their creative potential. I think the key for me is giving people responsibility \u2013 the chance to craft and research an idea so it\u2019s your own thing.<\/p>\n<p>When I\u2019m hiring, ultimately I always make the decision with my gut. I think, \u2018is this person really the right fit for us?\u2019 We also have a \u2018don\u2019t hire assholes\u2019 policy \u2013 it only takes one person to imbalance something that\u2019s very good.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article first appeared on TheJournal.ie in January 2018:<\/em>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/jrnl.ie\/3765196\">http:\/\/jrnl.ie\/3765196<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Laurence O\u2019Byrne is a creative director at creative advertising agency\u00a0Boys and Girls\u00a0who\u00a0has won a number of Cannes Lions and Kinsale Shark Awards.
