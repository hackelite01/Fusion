Brands have the power to not only impact culture, but shift it entirely. Acknowledging the context in which you\u2019re creating work is important. Our work doesn\u2019t go out into a vacuum. Those that tap into cultural insights, or contribute to culture, get noticed.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>\u2018Exploration of New Creative Processes\u2019<\/strong>, Nick Barham, Chief Strategy officer at Backslash, posited that <strong>\u201cculture is the competition\u201d<\/strong>. Backslash, TBWA\u2019s<strong> \u201ccultural editorial arm\u201d<\/strong>, was created in 2017 as a dedicated resource to discover ways in which TBWA can <strong>\u201cplay in culture\u201d<\/strong>. According to Barham, we either create work that has cultural value in some way, be it offering entertainment or contributing to culture change, or risk losing relevance.<\/p>\n<p>In one of the jury room sessions, a jury member commented that they sought out campaigns that not only captured the cultural zeitgeist, but solved cultural problems. However, they warned that for issues that have already been brought to light, bringing awareness to them is pointless. A solution to the problem must be offered.<\/p>\n<p>They commented on the power of a brand to change the cultural conversation and reminded the audience that brands are living in a world of transformation. They cited Nissan\u2019s <strong>\u2018She Drives\u2019<\/strong> as a piece of work that didn\u2019t simply comment on culture, but aided the cultural shift that was already happening in Saudi Arabia.<\/p>\n<p>This year Saudi Arabia overturned its ban on female drivers and, according to the jury, Nissan helped <strong>\u201csmooth the cultural change\u201d<\/strong> with their campaign. That\u2019s not to say that all <strong>\u201cculturally potent\u201d<\/strong> work must be worthy and purposeful. You can contribute to culture by simply making people laugh. \u201c<strong>There\u2019s a place for entertainment\u201d<\/strong>, said Leila Fataar during the \u2018Unskippable Craft\u2019 panel. \u201c<strong>You don\u2019t need to save the world, but you <\/strong><strong>do need to contribute\u201d<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<\/style>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UzYN0hPWcLA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Being culturally relevant doesn\u2019t mean just shoe-horning celebrities and influencers into your ads. In Campaign, James Murphy, writing about Cannes 2018, critiqued that, <strong>\u201cthere was still that strange obsession with celebrity \u2014 remember the time when advertising used to make culture rather than desperately try and attach <\/strong><strong>itself to it?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That being said, this was exactly what brought success to Wieden and Kennedy for their Nike Campaign, <strong>\u2018Nothing Beats a Londoner\u2019<\/strong>, which took home the Grand Prix in the inaugural Social and Influencer category. Jury president: Mark D\u2019Arcy, VP, Chief Creative Officer, Facebook Creative Shop, said, <strong>\u201cThe way this work was constructed really demonstrates how culture is shaped.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mEB1C59hCvs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Cultural potency can solve business problems, not just societal ones. Work was proven to have cultural impact if it earned attention, earned media, and earned influence, proving that cultural potency results in creative effectiveness. In fact, culturally significant work featured heavily in the Creative Effectiveness category, with campaigns including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VVWUlWEfJ1k\">Savlon: Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7IY77rr3nP4\">adidas Originals: Original is Never Finished<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5iPWCeKz4_c\">PEDIGREE: Child Replacement Programme<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iFCAd9ygmTM\">Amnesty International: The Refugee Nation<\/a> all getting metal. Proving that being culturally relevant has business rewards.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, advertising is about the practical application of creativity. We\u2019re an industry of problem solvers. For us, there\u2019s a requirement to solve a business problem, not just a societal one.<\/p>\n<p>So, how can we produce more culturally potent work? There\u2019s some obvious ways. By paying attention to what\u2019s going on in our society, being observant of culture, and by being open to being part of the conversation and cognizant of our ability to shape culture itself.<\/p>\n<p>As advised by one panel that featured the creators of Tide\u2019s Super Bowl cultural home run: <strong>\u2018Look for the next open space and occupy it.\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Read the next article:<\/h4>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/news\/breaking-through-the-glass\/\">Breaking through the glass<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>by Caroline Kehoe, Senior Account Director<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Or see <a href=\"\/news\/category\/cannes2018\/\">all our articles from Cannes Lions 2018<\/a><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A big takeout of Cannes 2018, from the talks to the winners, was the importance of creating culturally potent work.
