Including sleeping.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Growth-Time-Spent-with-Media-Slowing\/1014042\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Over 12 hours a day<\/a>\u00a0are spent immersed in TV, radio, print or online in some shape or form.<\/p>\n<p>Surely that should make advertising a piece of cake, right?<\/p>\n<p>But cutting through is harder than it\u2019s ever been.<\/p>\n<p>As an industry, advertising has tried to counter the fragmentation of the mass audience by churning out ads to plug every conceivable gap that we could create. The rise of programmatic and persistent advertising online has thrown a technical solution at a human problem and created a race to the bottom \u2013 simultaneously pissing off consumers and reducing revenue for content creators with negligible improvements for the brands.<\/p>\n<p>The mass audience is still out there, but they\u2019re no longer captive. In an on-demand world, anything that doesn\u2019t add to the experience can and will be blocked.<\/p>\n<p>Adblocking is often touted as proof of \u201cthe failure of digital advertising\u201d. To me, it\u2019s proof that the digital \u201cconsumer\u201d is now empowered by technology. If they could adblock offline, they would. Technology has enabled today\u2019s public to call \u2018bullshit\u2019. Display advertising is just the canary in the coalmine.<\/p>\n<p>Even the legendary adman, David Ogilvy, fantasised that on his retirement he would form a \u201csecret society of masked vigilantes\u201d that would go out in the dead of night to destroy billboards for being a blight on the landscape. \u201cMan is at his vilest when he erects a billboard.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-37339029\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Today, he would have launched a Kickstarter and actually done it.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-37339029\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-514 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/cats-pg.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of Citizens' Advertising Takeover Service (CATS) cat ads in London Tube station\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/cats-pg.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/cats-pg-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/cats-pg-1000x525.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/cats-pg-600x315.jpg 600w, https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/cats-pg-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As platforms and services become increasingly customer led and experience focused, this new \u2018expectation economy\u2019 has redefined what the consumer is willing to tolerate and what they expect. Good enough isn\u2019t good enough anymore.<\/p>\n<p>As an industry, we pride ourselves on being creative \u2013 hell, we\u2019ve even made it a job title \u2013 but we\u2019ve built a business model on selling the same old solution. We\u2019re simply filling more gaps in a media plan with more ads people don\u2019t want.<\/p>\n<p>Not very creative.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, it\u2019s a business model that doesn\u2019t match customer behaviour. There\u2019s only so long that can last before your entire business is disrupted&#8230; just ask the music and film industries. Their disconnect with consumer demand resulted in an explosion in piracy but creative thinking is helping to find new solutions. Legal streaming services like Spotify, Deezer, Netflix and Amazon are proof that there\u2019s a different way to reach the consumer. A mutually beneficial way. Piracy was the symptom of a broken model. Adblocking is just another symptom that the advertising model is broken.<\/p>\n<p>We need to learn from other industries\u2019\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/variety.com\/2013\/biz\/news\/epic-fail-how-blockbuster-could-have-owned-netflix-1200823443\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">refusal to embrace change<\/a>\u00a0before we go the way of the Blockbusters too.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time for advertising to put some of that creativity to use on our own business. The need for advertising is still alive and well but to connect with a consumer in an on-demand world requires advertising that\u2019s worth opting in to.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is still king. People still love to be surprised or informed or entertained. It\u2019s just that now when a client asks for advertising, the answer doesn\u2019t always look like an \u201cad\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What hasn\u2019t changed is the need for human insights, breakthrough ideas and emotional stories. Our connected world is giving brands more dimensions and touch points. New ways to engage the audience without relying on interruption. But there has to be a value exchange. If you\u2019re bringing nothing to the party, GTFO.<\/p>\n<p>We need to apply our creativity to not just the message but understanding how that idea will live in today\u2019s world. That\u2019s a challenge that requires real creativity.<\/p>\n<p>If you say you\u2019re selling creative thinking, make sure that\u2019s not false advertising.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article first appeared on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-37339029\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little Black Book on 18-11-16<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shane Casey, Head of Digital at Boys and Girls discusses how adblocking is just another symptom that the advertising model is broken<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":509,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"pgc_sgb_lightbox_settings":""},"categories":[3,4],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.1.1 -
