The award recognises a brand that, over the years, has demonstrated that they believe and invest in creativity.<\/p>\n<p>The MD of the Cannes Lions, Jose Papa, introduced her on stage by saying: <br \/>\n <strong>\u201c\u0007The Creative Marketer of The Year Award honours a brand that consistently delivers outstanding creative storytelling, challenges the status quo, and sets a global bench mark of excellence.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He went on to describe Google as an organisation that has changed our lives and the way our world runs:<br \/>\n <strong>\u201c\u0007Alongside it\u2019s obvious achievements as a tech company, Google has crafted a reputation as a brand that delivers marketing campaigns that are bold, courageous and creative at heart.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google has won 127 Lions since 2007, eight of which have been Grands Prix. In 2012, it reinvented Coca-Cola\u2019s classic <strong>\u2018Hilltop\u2019<\/strong> ad for a modern audience, enabling mobile users to send a stranger a free Coke anywhere in the world through connected vending machines.<\/p>\n<p>Their Grand Prix-winning work with DeepMind Alphago was not just a brilliant marketing opportunity for their tech capabilities, but also represented a genuine turning point for AI.<\/p>\n<p>The same can be said of Google\u2019s VR 3D painting app Tilt Brush, which has won two gold Lions. In 2015, the company also earned a Grand Prix for Google Cardboard, an invention that is, in many ways, the opposite of more tech heavy examples previously cited, and yet just as bar-raising. This VR viewer is made of basic materials but was the first step towards democratising the VR experience and gaining brands a mass audience in that space.<\/p>\n<p>So, what can we learn from Google? Their work consistently shows real people in real life, using Google tools to do something amazing. Their marketing efforts are all purely product-led. They are consistent in that everything they create is helpful. They aim to solve problems for the user, take pain away, and bring in Google cleverness to make the experience better.<\/p>\n<p>Having a positive impact on culture was something that came up in every<strong> \u2018Inside the Jury Room\u2019<\/strong> session in Cannes this year, and is something that can be taken on board by any brand \u2014 not just those who are the size of Google.<\/p>\n<p>Hailing from Carlow, Lorraine Twohill is only the second woman in 25 years to accept the Creative Marketer of the Year award in Cannes. She closed her winning speech, by saying that Google is <strong>\u201cnot an easy client\u201d<\/strong> and that the company doesn\u2019t give its agencies <strong>\u201ceasy briefs\u201d<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>She finished off by saying that being one of two women to accept the award is <strong>\u2018lonely\u2019<\/strong> and that she\u2019d like more women to be recognised with <br \/>\n the award.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Read the next article:<\/h4>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/news\/if-you-cant-move-people-you-cant-move-markets\/\">If you can&#8217;t move people, you can&#8217;t move markets<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>by Aoife Murphy, Senior Digital Strategist<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Or see <a href=\"\/news\/category\/cannes2018\/\">all our articles from Cannes Lions 2018<\/a><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year the Cannes Lions Creative Marketer of the Year went to Google Chief Marketing Officer, (and Irish woman), Lorraine Twohill.
