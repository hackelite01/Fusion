The title quote from Harjot Singh at the Future of Creative Effectiveness debate on the Thursday at Cannes captures the effort required perfectly. If your work doesn\u2019t make people feel, think, believe or do something \u2014 is it a metal-winning idea? Probably not.<\/p>\n<p>Calculating a <strong>\u2018winning formula\u2019<\/strong> for the Lions is a bit of a moving target. Trends and jurors change year to year as do the motivations of the winning work. However, compelling people to act has always been the primary goal of advertising and there were clear themes throughout the winning work this year.<\/p>\n<p>Cannes Lions are about being first. The first to execute an idea, apply an insight, use a technology, create a new product, identify an issue. The judges have Google, if it\u2019s been done before the work comes off the shortlist table. A clever application of this first mentality was use of facial recognition to help voters identify corrupt politicians via their smartphone in <strong>\u2018The Colour of Corruption\u2019<\/strong> for consumer watchdog, Reclame Aqui.<\/p>\n<p>Commercial success is rising higher up the judging agenda but impact on culture was a heavy presence in this year\u2019s work. Proof of impact via behaviour change or public discussion was a big signifier of good work at this year\u2019s awards. Pedigree\u2019s<strong> \u2018Child Replacement Programme\u2019\u00a0<\/strong>is a great example of this, the <br \/>\n idea calling for empty nesters to adopt a dog drove an 8% increase in sales alongside global PR for a domestic campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Moving people requires a connection. Emotion is a much-employed tactic in advertising and while the usual tear-jerkers apply, work that catches you off guard is equally as memorable. In fact, according to a 2017 review of four years of Lion-winning case studies, advertising reported as annoying or weird made up 34% <br \/>\n of the top work. A great example of <strong>\u2018weird\u2019<\/strong> gold winning work in print and outdoor from KFC.<\/p>\n<p>Many charity metal-winning pieces get a lot of flak for not being brand or business related. Indeed, social change and cause marketing was omnipresent at this year\u2019s Cannes but jurors appeared to be more interested in what brands were doing to contribute to the solution rather than just raising awareness. The wonderful \u2018Trash Isles\u2019 by Plastic Oceans and LadBible took a well-known issue, the plastic pollution in our seas, and drove towards a solution by creating a campaign with so much momentum that it was raised at the UN.<\/p>\n<p>And then of course there are the outliers that could never be predicted or created by an algorithm. Work that is so beautifully crafted and unique in its execution that it deserves to be recognised as a beacon in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>This year was not short of examples. Apple was one of the standout clients with a number of gongs in the craft categories led by their \u2018Welcome Home\u2019 spot featuring FKA Twigs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Read the next article:<\/h4>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/news\/top-six-cannes-takeaways\/\">Top Six Cannes Takeaways<\/a><\/h2>\n<h4>Or see <a href=\"\/news\/category\/cannes2018\/\">all our articles from Cannes Lions 2018<\/a><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winning a Cannes Lion isn\u2019t supposed to be easy.
