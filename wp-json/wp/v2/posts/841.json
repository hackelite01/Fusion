However Cannes Lions defines itself as not just an advertising awards, but as a \u201cFestival of Creativity\u201d. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a home (and a category) for every type of creative thinking; from advertising to entertainment, charitable to commercial, analogue to digital. With the best of the best from around the world to choose from, I was intrigued to see how the juries would define \u201cinnovation\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The cynic in me expected to see the latest technologies rolled out as <strong>\u201cworld firsts\u201d<\/strong>, and there certainly was that in spades. Spotify deployed robot sculptors to immortalise rappers, TD bank created an ad in the blockchain (that literally no-one will ever see) and IBM\u2019s Watson picked up more metal than a scrapyard crane. If something could be 3D scanned, 3D printed or recreated in virtual reality, it was \u2014 from Edvard Munch\u2019s paintbrushes to Billy Corgan\u2019s hairless head.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was encouraging to see a clear bias from a lot of the juries toward \u201creal innovation\u201d rather than tokenistic technology. I spent a lot of my time in Cannes at the \u2018Inside the Jury Room\u2019 sessions, where jurors would discuss their favourite winners from their category and reveal the main topics of debate and discussion in the jury rooms. The Innovation, Digital Craft, Creative Data and Mobile juries all repeated the same mantra \u2014 they were much more interested in the creative application of existing technologies than first-mover uses of new technologies.<\/p>\n<p>For example, with <strong>\u2018ATMs that Listen\u2019<\/strong> the CommonWealth Bank in Australia repurposed their network of over 4000 ATMs nationwide to not just handle banking transactions, but also to survey their customers. With over 1.2 million responses to date (second only to the Australian census), Commonwealth Bank have made a powerful business tool out of their existing infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<\/style>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4_-jg_zOtmo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, the Digital Craft jury raved about <strong>\u2018Touching Masterpieces\u2019<\/strong> that employed haptic gloves, around since the 90s, to enable the blind to <strong>\u2018see\u2019<\/strong> sculptural masterpieces at the National Gallery in Prague. While badged as the <strong>\u2018World\u2019s first VR experience for the blind\u2019<\/strong> its charm and innovation still lay in an unconventional use of long-standing tech.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VuPGny-cIik?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even the simple poster, the last thing you\u2019d expect in Innovation categories, was reinvented as <strong>\u2018The Dissolving Posters\u2019<\/strong> to combat the spread of Zika and Dengue fever in the Brazilian favelas. Made of rice paper, they\u2019d dissolve in the rain and distribute a powerful insecticide to kill mosquito larvae before they even mature.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oWqnsUIM0zE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And possibly my favourite piece of work, <strong>\u2018My Line\u2019<\/strong>, for the Colombian Ministry of Communications and Information, brought free access to Google to Colombia\u2019s poorest and remotest areas via the phone. They created a toll-free number (<strong>\u20186000913\u2019<\/strong>, think about it&#8230;) that Colombians could call from their phones. Their search queries and results were handled in real-time by Google\u2019s voice assistant. For a country with severely limited internet access, it suddenly gave access to Google\u2019s wealth of information to 99.3% of the population. Such an ingeniously simple repurposing of the phone that the juries had to spend a long time ensuring it hadn\u2019t been done before.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0ZVjhTltaIA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The approach of assigning new tasks to readily available tools, technologies and objects around us was a real inspiration to me. We\u2019re surrounded by things that we assume to only have the predefined purpose we\u2019re accustomed to. If we can challenge our own preconceptions of the functional limitations of our surroundings or organisations, we have everything we need to deliver real world innovation&#8230; without a huge R&amp;D budget.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Read the next article:<\/h4>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/boysandgirls.ie\/news\/trick-shots\/\">Trick Shots<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>by Rory Hamilton, Executive Creative Director<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Or see <a href=\"\/news\/category\/cannes2018\/\">all our articles from Cannes Lions 2018<\/a><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Innovation is a much-abused word in advertising.
