By Rory Hamilton, Executive Creative Director at Boys+Girls<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An interesting thing happened at the Oscars last week. Something that garnered less column inches Joaquin\u2019s speech, Parasite\u2019s triumph, Saoirse\u2019s disappointment, or even Billy Porter\u2019s incredible dress. A film called \u201cHair Love\u201d won Best Animated Short and won the first Oscar for the brand Dove and in a way for their agency Ogilvy. Yes, this can be seen as the ultimate expression of the Ad Industry\u2019s obsession with awards ( to paraphrase Sally Field\u2019s famous acceptance speech \u201cYou like us, you really like us?) , but more importantly, the Oscar signals a huge shift in advertising. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more than decade now, Advertising has been obsessed by\nefficiency. We\u2019ve have prioritised measurement above all else, obsessively\ncounting eye balls, click-through rates and dwell times. We\u2019ve been seduced by\nimpressions and have been dancing to the tune of massive tech companies who\nprofit from us obsessively tweaking an algorithm that has always been rigged in\nthe house\u2019s favour. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with efficiency, by focussing\nso much of our energies on squeezing more and more out of our work, we have\ncreated a vicious cycle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see while the work has become harder working, and more\nfocused shorter term metrics, it has become much less interesting. As a result,\nmore than 1.7 billion Ad-blockers have been downloaded to avoid our work,\nmaking an objection to ads &#8211; the largest single boycott in human history. Think\nabout that for a second. Avoiding our work has become a billion dollar\nindustry. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows is obvious. People become smarter at avoiding\nads, so we become even better at tracking them. We micro target and develop\nArtificial Intelligence to programmatically tweak our copy and follow them\naround the internet. So people become even more resentful of our intrusion. And\nwhy wouldn\u2019t they? Advertising has always been a simple contract between\naudience and advertiser. They give us a small amount of their attention, and we\nreward that attention with an entertaining message. It\u2019s a contract that\nbrought us Smash Martians and Cadbury\u2019s Gorilla. It\u2019s the deal that makes us\nlook forward to John Lewis ads and the return to the radio of Barry\u2019s Tea\ntrainset ad every Christmas\u2013 entertaining stories with a brand message baked\ninto their heart. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Hair Love | Oscar\u00ae-Winning Short Film (Full) | Sony Pictures Animation\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kNw8V_Fkw28?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to see how the contract got broken, a drive for\nefficiency changes everything. Take the Barry\u2019s Tea radio ad for example. Efficiency\nmakes us measure listeners and agree that the ad is too long for starters. So we\u2019d\nshorten the story so we could run it more often. Just nip and a tuck of the\nscript here and there, lose the bit about rashers and milky tea, and you have a\nmuch more efficient ad. Efficiency means that surely the brand has to come into\nthe story earlier, get the tea upfront. Can we add in a decaf option? After all\nthe ad will run until January when health will be huge. Every decision makes\nperfect sense, but the result is ad that no one will listen to. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Dove and many other bands are starting to realise is\nthat while Efficiency drives a vicious cycle, Entertainment drives a virtuous\none. When the focus becomes about entertainment, the deal changes. Take John\nLewis again, every year we wait for the new ad to \u201cdrop\u201d. Newspapers fight to\nbe the first to break the story of the new campaign and sites push the content\nto their audience. This isn\u2019t bought space, it\u2019s given over because people\ndon\u2019t resent the work, they seek it out. When you make your work Entertaining,\nyou have to spend less money shoving it down people\u2019s throats. The\nentertainment effect takes hold. People remember the work, they share it. It\nenters our consciousness and provides genuine long term brand growth. A simple\nchange of focus changes everything. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate expression of the entertainment effect lies in\ncampaign\u2019s like \u201cHair Love\u201d&nbsp; &#8211; a film\nthat, rather than making a brand to pay for an audience\u2019s attention, the\naudience will pay to see. Don\u2019t believe me? Well look at the Skittles musical\nthat premiered last year to paying audience off Broadway. Or the any one of the\nLego Movies which in the US alone have earned more than $420 million at the Box\nOffice (before you add the revenue from the merchandise) &nbsp;Nowhere is this more obvious than in the\nsimple fact, that while we will download an ad blocker to avoid advertising, we\nalso download software that helps us steal entertainment. \n\n\n\nMaking\nyour work entertaining isn\u2019t more expensive, or necessarily even more\ndifficult. And if you don\u2019t know how to do it there are plenty of experts in\nthe industry that can help. To start, look for an agency that wins the awards\nthat measure entertainment \u2013 the creative ones. Any agency that\u2019s looking for\nan Oscar is a good place to start. \n\n\n\n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article first appeared in\u00a0marketing.ie\u00a0in February 2020.
